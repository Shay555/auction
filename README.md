Stream 3 Project

For my Stream-3 project, i decided to create an auction website. My father is a model train collector and as a result i tried to create a train auction site similiar to ebay as a way for him to maybe list items that he may want to sell. To strart i add a register page to allow users to either sign in or register for the site.

The sell page allows members to browse, list and buy items.

There is also an image gallery page allowing users to upload images of thir own layout and share them  with other users.

The blog page allows users to post feedback on purchases and respond to other members posts.

The contact us page allow users to contact the site if any issues arise with purchases or any other issues.

Like with most auction sites there is a selling policy and that is the last page. This justy details the policies which govern the site.
